| Read Me for Daniel Harris' Thesis CD |
----------------------------------------

The following folders are found on the CD:
* Code *
This folder contains the full source as well as test videos used for the focus of attention model. The main file to run is "ProcessVideoSaliency.m". This file takes a path to a video and will produce output to the screen as well as the other (currently empty) folders found on the CD. 

To fine tune what type of output you want to see, edit the ProcessVideoSaliency.m file. There are a number of bit flags that you can set at the top of the source file which will specify different types of output as well as a few other parameters like weather or not to down-sample the video for speed. The current defaults should suffice for most cases.

Note: Each source file should contain enough comments to be understandable if read alongside the thesis. 

* Presentation
This folder contains the defense presentation in Microsoft Power Point (.ppt) and PDF formats.

* References
This folder contains a collection of PDF's used as references in the thesis itself. It does not contain every reference (since some were books), but it contains most of them.

* Report
This folder contains the thesis proposal, final report, and defense announcement. All are available in PDF format.
